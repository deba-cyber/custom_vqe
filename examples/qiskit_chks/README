# Running with qiskit implementation with UCCSD ansatz with Hartree-Fock reference state, 'sto3g' basis. 

# the systems are defined in the examples/ folder with following default options:

The circuit is generated without any reduction of excitations with minimal basis `sto3g`, i.e. which is 
transpiled with a generic backend. This runs are for mainly for checking resource requirements in terms 
of number of qubits, circuit depth etc. 

For example, a file "h2.dat" has geometries for H2 molecule, the circuit details are saved in "h2_data"
(the molecule filename is `molecule.dat` and datafile name is `molecule_data`.)


# User options:
    - "basis" in electronic structure calculation [default is kept `sto3g`]

	- "FreezeCore" in electronic structure calculation [default is kept False]
	  (If it's made True, user need to also give orbitals to remove i.e. 
	  understanding of the system)

	- "encoding" in Fermionic-Qubit mapper [default is JordanWignerMapper]

	- "optimizer" in minimization [default is kept "COBYLA"]

	- "maxiter" in minimization [default is kept 1000]
